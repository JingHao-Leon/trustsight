"""Specific payload rules and the bounded URL extraction they feed.

The G-series joins findings, not only artifacts.  A rule qualifies for that
join when its firing is a *specific* payload claim rather than a broad
practice: ``R001`` is "a remote script is piped to a shell", while ``R010`` is
"the recipe mentions curl".  The allowlist below is the membership test, so a
new broad heuristic cannot silently widen the campaign join.

URLs are extracted from the finding's already-bounded ``reason`` and
``evidence`` text.  Nothing is fetched, nothing is resolved, and a URL that
cannot be parsed is simply not joined.  A per-package cap bounds an
attacker-influenced member list.
