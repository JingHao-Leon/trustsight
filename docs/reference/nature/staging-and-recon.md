# Staging and Reconnaissance: Rule Nature

Mechanics live on the [Staging and Reconnaissance system page](../rules/staging-and-recon.md).

## Where it comes from

Before an attacker exfiltrates or pivots, they look around: environment
variables, `whoami`, hostnames, cloud metadata endpoints, SSH keys, wallets,
browser stores. In a build container this reconnaissance is a written-down
step, so it is auditable. The rules cover the read-the-target behaviours that
have no place in building a package: probing the metadata service, walking
credential paths, and staging files for a later fetch.

Not every `env` is recon; the rules target the recognisable credential and
cloud-metadata shapes rather than generic introspection. The value is that a
recon step turns an otherwise-ambiguous fetch into a deliberate
look-then-take sequence.

## What a finding means

- The finding names the target being read (a metadata IP, a credential path,
  a wallet directory). Read it as intent evidence: the package is
  accumulating material it was not asked to touch.
- Recon alone may be weight of evidence rather than a verdict; recon followed
  by a network send is the pattern to escalate.
- Some of these rules co-fire with crossfire and exfiltration families by
  design; the pairing is the signal.
