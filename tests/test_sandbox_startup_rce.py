"""The tokenizer worker must not run attacker code at interpreter startup.

A finding reported that the worker was launched with ``-s`` while inheriting
the parent's ``PYTHONPATH``.  ``-s`` only drops the user site directory; it
does not ignore ``PYTHONPATH``, and ``site`` imports ``sitecustomize`` from
``sys.path`` during startup.  So a writable directory on the inherited
``PYTHONPATH`` let an attacker drop a ``sitecustomize.py`` that ran before the
worker applied its resource limits or its best-effort network drop.

These tests pin the fix: the worker is launched isolated (``-I``) with a
minimal environment, and the poisoned startup file does not run.  The control
proves the poison *would* run under the old launch, so the test cannot pass
because the poison was inert.
